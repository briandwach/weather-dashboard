# Weather Dashboard

## The goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard application that requests weather data for a city and displays it in a manner suitable for a user.  The data will be retrieved from the OpenWeather API library and will contain a 5 day weather forecast for any city that is requested in a search.

I learned the following:
- How to user function parameters and lessen my use of global variables.
- The importance of reading API documentation. 


## Usage

The final website can be viewed here:
https://briandwach.github.io/weather-dashboard/

- In the search text box, type in the city in which you are traveling.
- The welcome box will confirm the city you have searched and inform you to find your data in the development console. 
- In the development console, data will have been retrieved for the geo location of the city and the city's 5 day weather forecast. 
- Data is provided by the OpenWeather API.
